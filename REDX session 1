REDX
Launch event was basically an interactive session with the people from REDX.
Just the increase in number of volunteers in wari each year, with no planning and knowledge even of the number of people coming in & going out, will not do. Its a gathering of people from different mental, physical & economical level. In developing countries, citizens are becoming digital well before cities are, and so we need facts(data) for predictive information for an analysed planning of the knowledge.

Technology driven is analytical solutions and planning to predictive knowledge ie. what we do in AI
real-time people counting system using mobile phone tower that can be used for counting & monitoring crowd flow
Tracking crowd flow and making routes for local public transportation
Providing housing and sanitary assistance as per requirement.
Prediction of weather and epidemics and quick health assistance using GPS coordinates
These activities too if directed by Kumbhathon mindset(as far as I have read)can be made up of four phases: Spot, Probe, Grow and Launch.

When we have upcoming engineers in such a close environment, it would lead to corporate ventures, startups and new research making the community self sustainable for such a huge gathering, calling it a wari not a undimentional crowd.

And we got the basic idea of how to choose a problem statement in the first session & we choose Energy Management as our vision of interest.
